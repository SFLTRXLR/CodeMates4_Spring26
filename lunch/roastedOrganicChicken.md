### Ingredients:
- 2 (8 lb) whole organic chicken
- 4 tbsp organic unsalted butter (softened)
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 2 whole lemon, halved
- 8 cloves garlic, smashed
- 6 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 tsp sea salt
- 1 tsp cracked black pepper

### Steps for preparation:
- Preheat: Set your oven to 218°C (425°F).
- Prep Chicken: Remove giblets. Pat the chicken extremely dry with paper towels (this is the secret to crispy skin).
- Season Cavity: Stuff the lemon halves, smashed garlic, and half of the herbs inside the chicken cavity.
- Coat: Rub the softened butter and olive oil all over the skin. Generously season the entire bird with salt and pepper.
- Roast: Place the chicken breast-side up in a roasting pan. Roast for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).
- Rest: Remove from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before carving to keep the juices locked in.

### Notes:
- For extra flavor, tuck small pieces of butter and herbs under the skin of the breast before roasting.
- Save the carcass to make an organic bone broth for future recipes!
