## Description

The New York Times states, "These cocoa-infused crepes are delicious rolled up and eaten as-is, but for a more celebratory dessert, dress them up with your choice of chocolate-hazelnut spread, whipped cream, powdered sugar and berries."

### Ingredients:
- ½ cup milk (1%, 2% or whole)
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan 
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 
- Chocolate-hazelnut spread, whipped cream, berries or powdered sugar (or a combination), for serving (optional)

### Steps for preparation:

1. Step One: To a medium bowl, add milk, egg, sugar, melted butter, vanilla and salt and whisk vigorously to combine. Sift in flour and cocoa powder and whisk until completely combined and smooth. (It’s OK if pieces of the butter solidify and rise to the surface.) Let the batter rest on the counter for at least 15 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. (If the batter will be refrigerated overnight, combine it in a blender to emulsify before refrigerating.)

2. Step Two: To cook the crepes, heat a 7-inch nonstick skillet (see Tip) over medium. Melt a pat of butter in the skillet and spread it across the pan. Using a quarter-cup dry measuring cup, pour a scant ¼ cup (about 3 tablespoons) batter into the center of the skillet and quickly swirl to coat the bottom of the pan in the batter. Cook, undisturbed, until the edges appear dry, 60 to 90 seconds. Shake the skillet to ensure the crepe is loose, and then use a thin spatula to help flip it over. Cook for 30 to 60 seconds more, until the underside is cooked through, and slide it off onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter (after cooking the first crepe, there’s no need to grease the pan again).

3. Step Three: If using, spread a generous teaspoonful of chocolate-hazelnut spread over one quadrant of a crepe. Fold in half and then into quarters. (Alternatively, spread the chocolate-hazelnut spread in a line down the center of the crepe, then roll into a tight log.) Repeat with remaining crepes. Serve immediately, topped with whipped cream, berries or powdered sugar (or a combination) if desired.

### Notes:

To ensure you have the correct pan size, be sure to measure the diameter of the base of the pan.
